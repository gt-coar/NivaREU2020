# NivaREU2020

Hello this is Niva's REU 2020 Project Code
This is an instruction manual on how to run the code
The code goes through different Temporal Difference Learning methods



To get started:
Each algorithm is separated into different files

Here are basic steps to run an algorithm and understanding as to what is in the file

1. Choose the algorithm and then choose that file

  TDonMDP.ipynb is On-Policy TD(0)
  
  Off-PolicyTD(0).ipynb is Off-Policy TD(0) with importance sampling
  
  SynchronousTD.ipynb is Synchronous On-Policy TD(0)
  
  On-Policyn_stepTD.ipynb is On-Policy n-step TD
  
  n-StepTDbySampling.ipynb is Off-Policy n-step TD with Importance Sampling ]
  
  V-trace.ipynb is V-trace algorithm
